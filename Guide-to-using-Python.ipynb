    "Did you combine different kinds of data types? Usually this isn't problem with Python as it automatically decides what the type is for variables, but sometimes it might create some problems if you combine integers, float or string type variables. In datasets sometimes even numbers are saved as a 'string', which is unfortunate to notice after doing something with the data. In Python there's different operators which can check what kind of type the variable is, such as isstring(). \n",
